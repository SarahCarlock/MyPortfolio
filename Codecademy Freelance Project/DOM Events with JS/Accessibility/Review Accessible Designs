ACCESSIBLE DESIGN
Review
Congratulations! You made the cupcake recipe site look much better! You practiced some new CSS syntax, and you learned the power of visual contrast, for both overall design, and for accessibility.

You gained some knowledge on web accessibility and how to make your websites usable for all users.

Remember, the keys to building a more visually inclusive Web are:

Using contrast so our text and colors provide better visual cues
Using correct font size so our content is legible
Creating user interfaces that are enhanced by, but not dependent on, color
Following these guidelines can increase the usability of our websites. In the next lesson, you will learn semantic HTML tags, which improve the accessibility of sites for people using a screen reader.
