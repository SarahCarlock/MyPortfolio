ACCESSIBILITY
Review: Accessibility
Using ARIA roles and properties, alt attributes, and semantic elements in your HTML is a simple way to make your website accessible to visually-impaired Internet users.

Using semantic HTML elements whenever possible (such as <header> instead of <div id="header">) will allow screen reader users to navigate your website more efficiently.
The role attribute is used to communicate information about the role of specific elements.
role="presentation" allows a screen reader to skip markup elements that don’t directly contain useful information.
aria-label and other ARIA properties can be used to help users perceive information that is communicated visually but not through text.
The alt attribute should be added to every image element (and all other elements that support it) instead of aria-label. When used, its value should be a useful description of the image.

The <article> and <section> tag are used to describe a region’s content.
The aria-labelledby attribute must match the unique id of its corresponding label.
