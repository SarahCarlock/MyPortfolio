Review: Git and GitHub, Part I
Review what you just learned in the Git and Github, Part I Unit.

Congratulations! The goal of this unit was to introduce you to the Git versioning technology. Understanding Git is a crucial tool in your developer toolkit—but don’t worry if it didn’t stick! Practice is crucial with Git, which is why we introduced it early in the Path. You also now know how to take the repositories on your computer and put them online with GitHub. Having your work on Github will be important when you apply for jobs, and now you also know how to write a solid README.md with markdown.

Having completed this unit, you are now able to:

Version control projects using Git
Backtrack in Git
Host a codebase online using GitHub repositories
Use markdown to author a good README.md file
If you are interested in learning more about these topics, here are some additional resources:

Documentation: GitHub Docs
Resource: GitHub Cheatsheet
Video Playlist: Get Up and Running on Git and GitHub
Resource: GitHub Learning Lab
Resource: Markdown and Visual Studio Code
Resource: GitHub Guide to Markdown
Remember, you will put all of this knowledge into practice with an upcoming Portfolio Project. If you ever get stuck while working on the project, you can come back to this Unit and review what you have learned.

Learning is social. Whatever you’re working on, be sure to connect with the Codecademy community in the forums. Remember to check in with the community regularly, including for things like asking for code reviews on your project work and providing code reviews to others in the projects category, which can help to reinforce what you’ve learned.
