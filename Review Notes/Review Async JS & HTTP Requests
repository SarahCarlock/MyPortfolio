Review: Async JavaScript and HTTP Requests
In this Unit, you learned about asynchronous JavaScript and how to use it to make HTTP requests to APIs.

Congratulations! The goal of this unit was to understand APIs and introduce asynchronous JavaScript and the concepts behind HTTP requests.

Having completed this unit, you are now able to:

Write asynchronous JavaScript with async-await and promises syntax
Explain the different types of HTTP requests
Describe REST protocol
Work with JSON data
Make HTTP requests to external web APIs
If you are interested in learning more about these topics, here are some additional resources:

Documentation: Ajax

Resource: MDN’s Guide to Graceful asynchronous Programming with Promises
Resource: MDN’s Guide to Choosing the Right Approach
Article: MDN’s Introduction to web APIs
Article: MDN’s Overview of HTTP
Resource: MDN’s Guide to Fetching Data From the Server
Documentation: MDN: Using the Fetch API
Resource: MDN’s Guide to Third-party APIs
Remember, you will put all of this knowledge into practice with an upcoming Portfolio Project. If you ever get stuck while working on the project, you can come back to this Unit and review what you have learned.

Learning is social. Whatever you’re working on, be sure to connect with the Codecademy community in the forums. Remember to check in with the community regularly, including for things like asking for code reviews on your project work and providing code reviews to others in the projects category, which can help to reinforce what you’ve learned.
