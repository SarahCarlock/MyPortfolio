DOM EVENTS WITH JAVASCRIPT
Review
Congrats, you completed the lesson! Now you’ve learned about JavaScript events and you can leverage these events on the DOM to create interactivity with event handlers.

Let’s review what you’ve learned:

You can register events to DOM elements using the addEventListener() method.
The addEventListener() method takes two arguments: an event type and an event handler function.
When an event is triggered on the event target, the registered event handler function executes.
Event handler functions can also be registered as values of onevent properties of their event target.
Event object properties like .target, .type, and .timeStamp are used to provide information about the event.
The addEventListener() method can be used to add multiple event handler functions to a single event.
The removeEventListener() method stops specific event handlers from “listening” for specific events firing.

JavaScript interprets event as objects in the DOM with pre=determined properties and methods.

The event target is the DOM element that the event fires on.
