That completes our lesson on props! Here are some of the skills that you’ve learned:

Passing a prop by giving an attribute to a component instance.
Accessing a passed-in prop via props.propName.
Displaying a prop.
Using a prop to make decisions about what to display.
Defining an event handler in a function component.
Passing an event handler as a prop.
Receiving a prop event handler and attaching it to an event listener.
Naming event handlers and event handler attributes according to a convention.
Accessing props.children.
Assigning default values to props.
That’s a lot! Don’t worry if it’s all a bit of a blur. You’ll soon get plenty of practice!

What does props.children return? Everything between a componenet's opening and closing tags.
If there are no props passed to a componenet, the component will render, but with empty values for any missing props.
In React, Props are accessible in a componenet via the props object, where prop names are keys and their values are the values pased in vai JSX.
