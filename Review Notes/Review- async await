Review
Awesome work getting the hang of the async...await syntax! Let’s review what you’ve learned:

async...await is syntactic sugar built on native JavaScript promises and generators. It doesn't introduce new functionality into JS.
We declare an async function with the keyword async.
Inside an async function we use the await operator to pause execution of our function until an asynchronous action completes and the awaited promise is no longer pending .
await returns the resolved value of the awaited promise. IT's an operator used only inside an async function that halts the execution of a function until a given promise is no longer pending and returns the resolved value of the promise.
We can write multiple await statements to produce code that reads like synchronous code.
We use try...catch statements within our async functions for error handling.
We should still take advantage of concurrency by writing async functions that allow asynchronous actions to happen in concurrently whenever possible.
Promise.all() is useful for awaiting multiple promises where all are required but none depends oneach other to execute.
async...await doesn't cause promises to resolve faster.
