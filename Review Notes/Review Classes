Review: Classes
Way to go! Let’s review what you learned.

Classes are templates for objects.
Javascript calls a constructor method when we create a new instance of a class.
Inheritance is when we create a parent class with properties and methods that we can extend to child classes. Intended to share data and objects between instances.
We use the extends keyword to create a subclass.
The purpose of the constructor(): it is called when you create a new instance of a class. It sets the property values for each instance.
The super keyword calls the constructor() of a parent class. When you create a subclass using the extends keyword, the subclass does not set parent properties unless you call the super Keyword. The subclass inherits all of the parent's getters, setters, and methods. You can also use the super keyword to set properties in the parent class.
Static methods are called on the class, but not on instances of the class.
In completing this lesson, you’ve taken one step closer to writing efficient, production-level JavaScript. Good luck as you continue to develop your skills and move into intermediate-level concepts.
