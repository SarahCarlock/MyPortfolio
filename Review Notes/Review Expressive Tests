Review
You can now write tests with Node’s assert library! In this lesson you learned to:

Check for loose (==) equality with assert.equal()
Check for strict (===) equality with assert.strictEqual()
Check the equality of two object’s values with assert.deepEqual()
Make your tests expressive by using different assert methods found in the Node.js documentation.
As you continue to write tests, remember to always evaluate them against the characteristics of a good test: fast, complete, reliable, isolated, maintainable, and expressive. If you are meeting these six criteria, you are creating high quality test frameworks!

Four phases of a test: setup, exercise, verify, teardown.
NOT a correct sentence: Cose should be tested in other programming languages.
Mocha is used for organizing and automating tests that provide useful feedback when errors occur.
What is the outcome of the following code: assert.ok(false);  = An error is thrown.
Mocha it() function: takes two arguments. The it() function takes two arguments. First, a string that will be printed in the test suite, then a callback function that executes the code to be tested
Which of the following is true about tests? Tests should run in isolation. One test should not affect another and they should all be able to run in any order.
Definition of the Exerccise Phase of a test: Execute the functionality you are testing.
