Review
You can now write tests with Mocha and Nodeâ€™s assert.ok() ! In this lesson you learned to:

Install Mocha with npm
Organize tests with describe() and it()
Ensure your tests are isolated and expressive with the four phases of a test
Ensure your tests are reliable with hooks
Write assertions with assert.ok()
As you continue to write tests, remember to always evaluate them against the characteristics of a good test: fast, complete, reliable, isolated, maintainable, and expressive. If you are meeting these six criteria, you are creating high quality test frameworks!

example
const assert = require('assert');
const fs = require('fs');

describe('appendFileSync', () => {
  const path = './message.txt';
  
  it('writes a string to text file at given path name', () => {

    // Setup
    const str = 'Hello Node.js';
    
    // Exercise: write to file
    fs.appendFileSync(path, str);

    // Verify: compare file contents to string
    const contents = fs.readileSync(path);
    assert.ok(contents.toString() === str);

    // Teardown: delete path
    fs.unlinkSync(path);

  });
});
