Congrats, we’ve now gone through the basics of web APIs! Here’s a quick recap of what we covered:

With web APIs, we have a tool that we can use to access the functionality and data of another application.
There are two main types of APIs: browser and third-party.
Browser APIs require specific syntax and permissions.
Third-party APIs have their own rules and requirements set by the organizations that maintain them.
When making a request to API, we might have to supply more details about what information we want.
If we get a successful response, we still have to decide how to consume the response data.
That’s a lot to take in, but knowing that these tools exist opens up more possibilities for what we can do with our apps!
