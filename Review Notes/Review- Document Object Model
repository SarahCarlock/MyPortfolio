THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
Review
Congratulations on completing our introduction to the Document Object Model, or DOM, as a structure!

Let’s review what you’ve learned so far:

The DOM is a structural model of a web page that allows for scripting languages to access that page.
The system of organization in the DOM mimics the nesting structure of an HTML document.
Elements nested within another are referred to as the children of that element. The element they are nested within is called the parent element of those elements.
The DOM also allows access to the attributes of an HTML element such as style, id, etc.
With this understanding, you can begin to leverage the power of scripting languages to create, update, and maintain web pages!

Node- Tags are element nodes (or just elements) and form the tree structure: <html> is at the root, then <head> and <body> are its children, etc. The text inside elements forms text nodes, labelled as #text . A text node contains only a string. It may not have children and is always a leaf of the tree.
